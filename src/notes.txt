TO DO:
[] Home         | Make sure the correct score is showing in the live and previous games
[] Scoreboard   | Team names need to be shortened, the longer names are causing the score area to get bigger and smaller
[] Scoreboard   | When selecting a game from the live home game, that game's details should load in the scoreboard
[] Scoreboard   | Every time a game action occurs, save the data to the local storage
[] FormNewGame  | Validation - When creating a new game, make sure there are at least two team names, and at least one player per team
[] FormNewGame  | After clicking add player button, set the cursor back to the corresponding player field
[] FormNewGame  | Ensure the team name can fit, may need to slice it
[] Scoreboard   | Implement functionality where if the user first records an assist, we prompt right away options for 2PTFG and 3PTFG for a specific player.
